    Read the theme and analyze and review the list of items associated with it.
    Based on that information, write a list of 7–10 jokes using the following rules:

    Each joke must be a one-liner — a concise, self-contained joke delivered in 1–2 sentences with a two-part structure:
    the first part (setup) establishes a scenario, and the second part (punchline) delivers an unexpected twist or conclusion that subverts the setup.

    You may use one or more of the following comedic strategies:

    Wordplay or pun: Using words with multiple meanings or similar sounds to create humorous ambiguity or surprise.

    Misdirection: Leading the audience to expect a certain outcome, only to reveal a different, often contradictory or absurd, conclusion.

    Exaggeration: Amplifying a characteristic, situation, or behavior to absurd levels to highlight its comedic potential.

    Stereotyping: Using exaggerated and oversimplified characterizations of groups or individuals for comedic effect.

    Satire: Using humor, irony, or exaggeration to critique or mock people, institutions, societal norms, or other targets.

    Absurdity or surreal humor: Creating comedy through illogical, bizarre, or nonsensical scenarios or statements.

    Dark humor: Making light of topics that are generally serious, taboo, or morbid.

    Juxtaposition: Placing two contrasting ideas or scenarios side by side for comedic effect, emphasizing their differences.

    Provide your results as a numbered list.
